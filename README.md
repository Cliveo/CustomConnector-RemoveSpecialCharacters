# Power Automate - Custom Connector C# – Remove special characters
A common requirement is the ability to remove special characters from a string. Power automate has some basic string expressions, but to remove a set of special characters from any given string is harder than it should be.

## Common solutions:
A big expression with nested replace (less actions but hard to read)

A loop within power automate (lots of actions & not scalable)

## My solution – Custom connector with C# code
Microsoft documentation can be found here
